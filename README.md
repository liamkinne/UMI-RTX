# UMI-RTX
This project is referbishing a vintage robot arm and applying it as a parts loader for a CNC machining centre. The aim is to test the waters of what is possible with automation while keeping development costs low.

# Origins
The robot arm was given to me after it was damaged in a flood. I did a full tear down, clean up and assesment to find that while the mechanics did work, it's difficult to be sure that the control electronics still work. Rather than sinking hours into getting the original electronics working, it's better to spin a minimum viable solution that can work fast or fail fast.
